> Implementation of "GAF-Net: Video-Based Person Re-Identification via Appearance and Gait Recognitions" presented at VISAPP 2024.

## Overview

GAF-Net combines skeleton-based gait features with appearance features for video-based person re-identification. This is the first approach to integrate skeletal gait information (rather than silhouettes) with appearance data for Re-ID.

### Key Features
- Novel skeleton-based gait feature extraction using pose estimation
- Integration with multiple appearance backbones: OSNet, MGH, PiT  
- Weighted feature fusion approach
- Evaluation on iLIDS-VID dataset

## Results

| Method | Dataset | Rank-1 | Rank-5 | 
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| GAF-Net (PiT) | iLIDS-VID | **93.07%** | **99.27%** |
| GAF-Net (MGH) | iLIDS-VID | 90.40% | 98.66% |
| GAF-Net (OSNet) | iLIDS-VID | 70.93% | 88.40% |
