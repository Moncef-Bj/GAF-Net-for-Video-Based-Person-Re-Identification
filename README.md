# GAF-Net-for-Video-Based-Person-Re-Identification
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and additional resources for our paper titled "GAF-Net: Gait-Appearance Fusion Network for Video-Based Person Re-Identification". Our work introduces GAF-Net, a novel approach that integrates appearance with gait features, extracted from skeletal structures, to enhance the performance of person re-identification systems.

## Contents
- `src/`: Source code of the GAF-Net model.
- `data/`: Example datasets and instructions on how to prepare the data.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models and configuration files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage and results of the model.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and resources.

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the environment and installing dependencies will be provided here.

## Usage
Detailed instructions on how to use the model, including training and inference processes, will be added.
